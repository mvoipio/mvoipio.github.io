	<p>If you cut into a luceted cord, it starts unraveling if the end isn't finished somehow. You can of course knot the end or dip it in glue.
	
	<p>Jos haarukkanyörin katkaisee, se alkaa purkautua, ellei sitä viimeistellä jotenkin. Nyörin päähän voi tietenkin tehdä solmun tai pään voi kastaa liimaan. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.netknots.com/rope_knots/common-whipping">Common Whipping</a> 
	is a slightly more elegant way of finishing the cut end. But if your yarn is a bit thicker (or you have nimble fingers and a good eyesight), you can also finish the cut ends the same way you end a cord when luceting.</p>
	
	<p>Usually it is easier to make a cord to the correct measure than to fiddle with it afterwards. If you need 3 x 1.5&nbsp;meters of cord, it is a good idea to make three 1.5&nbsp;meter cords rather than one 5&nbsp;meter long, unless you really enjoy fiddling with the cut ends.</p>

	<p>For cutting and finishing you need a cord to be cut, scissors, two safety pins (or openable stitch markers) and a pin (if the yarn is thin) or a darning needle or a thin knitting needle (if the yarn is thicker); in any case something small and fairly sharp. Even a cocktail stick or a fork may do in a pinch.</p>
	
	<p>If your object is to create a given length, mark somehow (for example with a third safety pin) the point where the cord should end. If you cut a cord into several shorter cords, note that cutting and finishing shortens the end by about 5 cm.</p>

				<td class="topaligned">Take a cut end and the pin/needle and use it to pick out all the loose yarn ends. After that your cord end should have two small loops, one slightly lower than the other, and a yarn end. Pull gently the yarn end so that the cord unravels a bit and the yarn end gets longer. If you are making a certain length, unravel until you reach the marker for the end point.</td>

				<td class="topaligned">Place the cord on the table as if it was on a lucet. On the left the loop that is slightly higher up, on the right a loop and a yarn (the one you just pulled). Place a safety pin/stitch marker through the loop on the right.</td>
