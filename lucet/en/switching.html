	<p>It is best to make sure you have enough yarn for the entire cord. The takeup is about 10:1, i.e. ten meters of yarn becomes one meter of cord. But sometimes you for example have a knot in the yarn and you can't really lucet that, you have to cut away the knot and somehow continue after that with the new yarn.</p>
	
	<p>If your yarn is wool and felts, <a target="_blank" href="https://thefibreco.com/spit-splice-tutorial/">spit splicing</a> works wonders. Note that it won't work with superwash wool as that doesn't felt.</p>
	
	<p>If your yarn doesn't felt, but is fairly thick and twisted, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.craftsy.com/post/russian-join"/>Russian join</a> should work.</p>
		

	<h2>Switching yarn in the middle of the cord</h2>
	
	<p>A basic square lucet cord is actually hollow.</p>

	</figure>
	
	<p>Because the cord is hollow, it is possible to hide a new yarn inside the cord for some rounds and then switch, after which the old yarn is kept inside the cord for a bit and then cut. This way you can also create color blocks in your cord, the yarn that isn't being used travels inside the cord.</p>

	<p>I've made a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lucet.fi/video/hollow.mp4">little video on working with two yarns</a>.</p>
	
	
	<p>If you need a join that can take a lot of pulling, you can always put the yarns on top of each other and work the cord with two yarns for a bit. However, this way the join is quite a bit thicker than the rest of the cord.</p>
